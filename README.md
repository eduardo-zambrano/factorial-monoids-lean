# Lean 4 Formalization: Factorial Monoids via Labeled Factorization Counts

A Lean 4 formalization of the paper "Characterizing Factorial Monoids via Labeled Factorization Counts" by Eduardo Zambrano.

## Overview

This project proves that ordinary multiplication on natural numbers can be characterized purely through counting labeled factorizations. The main result shows that under three axiomatic properties (PP-D, PP-P, and CFI), a reduced atomic commutative monoid is factorial (has unique factorization).

## Main Results

|---------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| `cor_factorial` | Cor 8.4 | PP-D + CFI implies factorial | **Proven** |
| `thm_main` | Thm 9.1 | Main result (factorial + atoms infinite) | In progress |
| `atoms_infinite_of_CPL` | Thm 9.1(b) | CPL implies atoms are infinite | In progress |
| `prop_val_additive` | Prop 8.3 | Additivity of p-adic valuations | **Proven** |
| `cor_squarefree` | Cor 7.3 | Squarefree diagnostic lemma | **Proven** |
| `atoms_are_prime` | - | CFI implies atoms are prime | **Proven** |
| `prop_coprime_mult` | Prop 7.2 | Coprime multiplicativity | **Proven** |
| `Theorem_Local_SB` | Thm 6.2 | Local stars-and-bars | **Proven** |
| `Lemma_PP_Unique` | Lem 6.1 | Unique factorization in prime powers | **Proven** |

## Key Definitions

- **F_k(m)**: The number of ordered k-tuples (m_1, ..., m_k) with product m
- **PP-D** (Powers Distinct): The map e -> p^e is injective for atoms p
- **PP-P** (Prime Powers factorially closed): If x*y is in the submonoid generated by p, then so are x and y
- **CFI** (Coprime parts Factor Independently): A bijection F_2(x) x F_2(y) -> F_2(x*y) for coprime x, y
- **CPL** (Coprime tuples in every Length): For every r, there exist r pairwise coprime non-units
- **Reduced**: Units are exactly {1}
- **Atomic**: Every non-unit factors into atoms
- **Factorial**: Unique factorization into atoms
